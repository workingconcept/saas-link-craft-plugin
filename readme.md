## Field Example

There are some Craft service and variable classes that do a bit more, but those aren't fleshed out and documented yet.

Why Capsule, Harvest and Trello? That's just what we've used. Submit an issue or PR if there's a service you'd love to see added.

## Installation

- `composer require workingconcept/saas-link`
- `./craft install saas-link` or install from _Settings_ â†’ _Plugins_ in the control panel

## Support
